- Jaws [Identify Privilege Escalation Methods on a System]
- WinPeas [Similar to Jaws]
- PowerUp [Checks for System Misconfigurations]

## Bypass PowerShell Execution Policy

Local User can run this

```
powershell -ep bypass
```

## Bypass Anti-malware Scan Interface

```
Find command online...
```

## Run PowerUp.ps1

```
import-module .\powerup.ps1
Invoke-AllChecks
```

## JAWS and WinPeas are almost the same. They look for exactly the same information.
